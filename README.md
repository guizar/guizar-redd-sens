This is the code and data repository for preprint *Sensitivity of estimates of the effectiveness of REDD+ projects to matching specifications and moving from pixels to polygons as the unit of analysis*. Here we provide the post-matching summaries and VCS REDD+ details to re-create the paper's main findings and key figures (see `Analyses.md`).
